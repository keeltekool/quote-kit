## 1. Quotes (Hinnapakkumine) — Legal Framework

### 1.1 A Quote CAN Be Legally Binding

**Law:** Võlaõigusseadus (VÕS) § 16

A hinnapakkumine (price quote) that is:
- Sufficiently defined (scope of work + price + conditions)
- Addressed to a specific person (not a general price list)
- Indicates the provider's intent to be bound

...IS a **pakkumus** (binding offer) under VÕS § 16(1). When the client accepts it, a **binding contract** is formed per VÕS § 9.

**Furthermore:** VÕS § 639(1) PRESUMES that any estimate/budget in a work contract is **binding** — the tradesperson cannot charge more than quoted without prior notification.

### 1.2 How to Make a Quote Non-Binding

**VÕS § 16(2):** A proposal is NOT a binding offer if the person making it **expressly indicates** they do not consider themselves bound.

**Required disclaimers on every quote:**

```
Estonian (default):
"Käesolev hinnapakkumine on informatiivse iseloomuga ja ei kujuta
endast siduvat pakkumust VÕS § 16 tähenduses, kui ei ole eraldi
kokku lepitud teisiti. Lõplik hind täpsustatakse peale tööde
mahu kinnitamist."

English:
"This price quote is informational and does not constitute a binding
offer within the meaning of VÕS § 16, unless separately agreed
otherwise. Final price to be confirmed after scope verification."
```

### 1.3 Mandatory Quote Elements

Every quote generated by the app MUST include:

| Field | Required? | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Quote number | YES | Sequential, unique (e.g., HP-2026-001) |
| Issue date | YES | Auto-generated |
| **Validity period (kehtivusaeg)** | **YES — CRITICAL** | Default: 14 days. Must always be explicit. |
| Seller: company name | YES | From business profile |
| Seller: registry code | YES | Äriseadustik § 15(2) — mandatory on ALL business documents |
| Seller: address | YES | |
| Seller: VAT number (KMKR) | IF registered | Only if VAT-registered. NEVER show if not. |
| Seller: phone + email | YES | |
| Buyer: name | YES | Person or company |
| Buyer: address | YES | Job site or registered address |
| Buyer: registry code | IF B2B | Auto-fill from Äriregister |
| Description of work | YES | AI-generated, editable |
| Line items (service + materials) | YES | Separate lines for labor vs materials |
| Unit price + quantity | YES | |
| Subtotal (excl. VAT) | YES | |
| VAT rate + amount | IF VAT-registered | 24% standard. OMIT ENTIRELY if not registered. |
| Total (incl. VAT) | YES | |
| Disclaimers | YES | Non-binding clause, validity, exclusions |
| Additional work clause | YES | "Lisatööde korral lepitakse hind eraldi kokku" |
| Material price clause | RECOMMENDED | "Materjalide hinnad võivad muutuda vastavalt tarnijate hinnamuutustele" |
| Payment terms | YES | Default: 14 days, bank transfer |
| Bank details (IBAN) | YES | |
| Warranty info | RECOMMENDED | Default 2yr for B2C, custom for B2B |
| Consumer withdrawal notice | IF B2C off-premises | See Section 8 |

### 1.4 Quote Validity / Expiry Rules

**VÕS § 17:** If a term is specified, offer is valid until that term.

**VÕS § 18:** If NO term is specified:
- Offer made in person → lapses if not accepted immediately
- Offer sent remotely (email/SMS) → valid for "reasonable time" (practically 2-4 weeks for trades)

**APP RULE:** Validity period is ALWAYS explicit. Default: 14 days. User can change. Never leave blank.

## 2. Invoices (Arve) — Mandatory Fields & Rules

### 2.1 Two Invoice Types — VAT-Registered vs Non-VAT

The app MUST produce completely different invoice formats based on VAT status.

#### A. VAT-Registered Business (KMS § 37(7)) — 10 Mandatory Fields:

1. Sequential invoice number + issue date
2. Seller: name, address, **VAT registration number (KMKR)**
3. Buyer: name, address
4. Buyer's VAT number (if B2B and buyer is VAT-registered)
5. Name/description of goods or services
6. Quantity of goods / volume of services
7. Date of service delivery (if different from invoice date)
8. Unit price excluding VAT + any discount
9. Taxable amount per VAT rate, with applicable rate shown
10. VAT amount payable in EUR

**Plus:** Company registry code (Äriseadustik § 15(2)) — always mandatory.

#### B. Non-VAT Business (Raamatupidamise seadus § 7):

1. Document name + sequential number
2. Issue date
3. Seller: name, registry code, address
4. Buyer: name, address, registry code (if B2B)
5. Description of services
6. Quantity, unit price, total amount
7. Payment terms + bank details

**CRITICAL: NO VAT LINE AT ALL.** Not "KM 0%", not "käibemaks 0%", not "VAT exempt" — **completely omit any VAT reference.** A non-registered business showing VAT on an invoice becomes **liable for that VAT to the state** (KMS § 3 lg 5).

### 2.2 Invoice Numbering

- Must be **sequential** (järjestikune) per KMS § 37(7)(1)
- Must be **unique** — each number used only once
- Small gaps acceptable (cancelled invoices) but should be minimized
- Format is up to the business: `2026-001`, `A-001`, etc.
- Must be preserved in chronological order for **7 years**

### 2.3 Invoice Deadline

**KMS § 37:** Invoice must be issued within **7 calendar days** of:
- Service delivery date, OR
- Advance payment receipt date (whichever is first)

### 2.4 Credit Notes (Kreeditarve)

**KMS § 29(7):** A credit note may be issued when:
- Services do not meet requirements
- Services were not actually provided

A credit note may **NOT** be issued solely because the buyer failed to pay.

Requirements:
- Must reference the original invoice number
- Must contain same mandatory fields as regular invoice
- Must clearly state "Kreeditarve" (credit note)

### 2.5 Language

No legal requirement for invoices to be in Estonian specifically. However:
- EMTA may request translation during audit
- For consumer-facing docs, Estonian is expected
- **App default:** Bilingual (Estonian primary, English secondary) or Estonian-only

---

## 3. VAT (Käibemaks) — Rates, Thresholds, Rules

### 3.1 Current Rates (as of 2026)

| Rate | Applies To | Since |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **24%** | **Standard rate — ALL construction/trade services** | 1 July 2025 (permanent) |
| 13% | Accommodation services | 1 January 2025 |
| 9% | Books, medicines, medical devices, press | 1 January 2025 |
| 0% | Exports, intra-Community supply | — |

**There is NO reduced rate for construction, renovation, plumbing, electrical, or any trade services.** Both labor and materials are taxed at 24%.

**Legal basis:** KMS § 15

### 3.2 Registration Threshold

| Rule | Detail | Legal Basis |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Threshold | **€40,000** taxable turnover per calendar year | KMS § 19 lg 1 / § 19¹ lg 3 |
| Calculation | From 1 January of each year, Estonian supply only | KMS § 19¹ (amended 2025) |
| Registration deadline | **3 working days** from date threshold is exceeded | KMS § 20 lg 1 |
| Tax authority decision | 5 working days from application | KMS § 20 lg 3 |
| Retroactive effect | VAT must be charged from the date threshold was exceeded | KMS § 20 lg 3 |
| Penalty for late registration | €1,300 — €2,000 + retroactive VAT assessment + interest | Maksukorralduse seadus |
| Voluntary registration | YES, allowed below threshold | KMS § 20 lg 2 |

### 3.3 Reverse Charge (Pöördmaksustamine)

**Estonia does NOT apply domestic reverse charge to construction/trade services.**

KMS § 41¹ reverse charge applies ONLY to:
1. Immovable property (with voluntary VAT elected per § 16 lg 3)
2. Scrap metal
3. Gold material (325+ thousandths purity)
4. Specific metal products (since 2017)

**For tradespeople: always charge standard 24% VAT on invoices (if VAT-registered). No reverse charge complexity.**

---

## 4. Quote-to-Invoice Conversion

### 4.1 Legal Transformation

```
Quote (hinnapakkumine) → Client accepts → Contract formed (VÕS § 9)
→ Work performed → Invoice (arve) = payment demand under existing contract
```

The invoice is NOT a new legal relationship — it is a **payment demand** arising from the already-formed contract. The invoice must reflect the contract terms (price, scope).

### 4.2 Additional Work Beyond Original Quote

**VÕS § 639 — CRITICAL RULES:**

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Default presumption | Estimate is **binding** — contractor cannot exceed it |
| Overrun notification | Contractor MUST **immediately notify** client ("viivitamata teatama") |
| Client's options | Accept the overrun OR terminate the contract |
| Failure to notify | Contractor **cannot claim** compensation exceeding original estimate |

**App flow for additional work:**
1. Tradesperson discovers additional work needed
2. App creates "Additional Work Request" → sends to client
3. Client approves (digital confirmation)
4. Only then: additional work can be performed and invoiced
5. Final invoice shows: original quote + approved additions

---

## 5. Advance Payments (Ettemakse)

### 5.1 VAT Rules on Deposits

**KMS § 11 lg 1 p 2:** VAT becomes due when payment is received, EVEN BEFORE service delivery.

| Business Type | Advance Payment VAT | Invoice Deadline |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| VAT-registered | VAT due immediately on advance amount | **7 calendar days** from receipt |
| Non-VAT | No VAT implications | Standard accounting rules |

### 5.2 Advance Invoice Format

The advance invoice (ettemaksuarve) must:
- Clearly state it is an advance payment ("Ettemaksuarve" / "Advance invoice")
- Show the advance amount + corresponding VAT (if VAT-registered)
- Reference the original quote/order

### 5.3 Final Invoice Reconciliation

Final invoice must show:
- Total work: €X + VAT
- Less advance payment: -€Y
- Remaining balance: €Z

### 5.4 Common Practice

- **20-50%** advance is standard in Estonian construction/trades
- No legal maximum for advance payments
- Recommended default in app: 30% or 50%

---

## 6. Payment Terms & Late Interest

### 6.1 Payment Terms

| Transaction | Default | Maximum | Legal Basis |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **B2B** | 30 days | 60 days (longer only if explicitly agreed + not unfair) | VÕS § 82¹ |
| **B2G** (public sector) | 30 days | 60 days (exceptional cases) | VÕS § 82¹ |
| **B2C** (private person) | No statutory maximum | Freedom of contract | General VÕS |

**App default:** 14 days (common for trades). Configurable.

### 6.2 Late Payment Interest (Viiviseintress)

**Formula:** ECB main refinancing rate + 8% per year

**Current rate (H1 2026):** 2.15% + 8% = **10.15% per year**

**VÕS § 113:** Interest accrues **automatically from the day after the payment due date** — no reminder or formal demand needed.

**Rate updates:** Published semi-annually by Eesti Pank at eestipank.ee/volasuhete-intressimaar. App should reference this or allow manual update.

### 6.3 App Implementation

- Show payment due date on every invoice
- After due date: auto-calculate accrued interest at 10.15%/year
- Generate payment reminder with interest calculation
- Allow configurable interest rate (in case statutory rate changes)

## 7. Construction Trades — Licensing & Registration

### 7.1 Regulated vs Unregulated Trades

| Trade | MTR Required? | Pädev Isik? | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **Electricians** | YES | YES (Class A/B/B1/C) | Most heavily regulated. Elektriohutusseadus. |

| **HVAC** | YES | YES | Ventilation, heating, cooling |
| **Gas work** | YES (separate) | YES (separate cert) | Küttegaasi ohutuse seadus |
| **Painters / cosmetic finishing** | **NO** | **NO** | Unregulated unless involves structural changes |
| **General renovation** | Depends | If permit-level work | If scope triggers ehitusteatis/ehitusluba |

### 7.2 What Should Appear on Documents

For **regulated trades:**
- Company name + registry code (always)
- MTR registration status/reference
- Pädev isik name (recommended, not legally mandatory on invoices)

| A | ALL electrical installations including high-voltage |
| B | Low-voltage installations only |
| B1 | Low-voltage up to 63A main protection only |
| C | Repair of low-voltage equipment only (not installations) |

### 7.4 MTR Lookup

- **Portal:** https://mtr.ttja.ee/
- **Search:** https://mtr.ttja.ee/taotluse_tulemus
- **No public API** — manual lookup only
- Company identified by registry code in MTR

### 7.5 Building Permit Thresholds (Ehitusseadustik Lisa 1)

| Building Size | Height | New Construction | Renovation |
|--------------|--------|------------------|------------|
| 0-20 m² | ≤5m | No requirements | No requirements |
| 20-60 m² | ≤5m | Ehitusteatis + project | Ehitusteatis |
| 0-60 m² | >5m | **Ehitusluba** | Ehitusteatis + project |
| >60 m² | any | **Ehitusluba** | Ehitusluba or Ehitusteatis (depends on scope) |

### 7.6 App Onboarding Flow

During signup, ask:
1. Trade type (dropdown: electrical, plumbing, HVAC, gas, painting, general renovation, other)
2. If regulated trade → prompt for MTR registration confirmation
3. Optional: pädev isik name + certificate reference
4. Auto-include MTR reference on documents if provided

---

## 8. Consumer Protection (B2C)

### 8.1 Off-Premises Contract Rules

**VÕS §§ 46-49:** When a contract is concluded **at the customer's home** (väljaspool äriruume) — which is the norm for tradespeople:

**14-day withdrawal right (taganemisõigus)** applies.

The tradesperson MUST:
- Inform the consumer of the 14-day withdrawal right **before** contract conclusion
- Provide withdrawal form/instructions on a durable medium
- If work begins during withdrawal period → obtain express consent + acknowledgment

### 8.2 Exceptions (No Withdrawal Right)

1. **Service fully performed** with consumer's express prior consent + acknowledgment of lost withdrawal right
2. **Contracts under €20**
3. **Urgent repair/maintenance** expressly requested by consumer (but NOT for additional services offered during the visit)
4. Custom/personalized items made to consumer's specifications

### 8.3 Pre-Contractual Information (VÕS § 48)

Before concluding a B2C contract, the tradesperson MUST inform consumer of:
- Business name, address, phone, email
- Main characteristics of the service
- **Total price including taxes** (or calculation method if price can't be determined)
- Payment terms and delivery schedule
- Warranty conditions (if applicable)
- Withdrawal right conditions
- Complaint handling procedure
- Contract duration and termination conditions

### 8.4 App Implementation

For B2C quotes:
- Auto-include withdrawal rights notice (taganemisõiguse teade)
- Add checkbox: "Client acknowledged withdrawal right" (Klient kinnitab taganemisõigusest teavitamist)
- If "urgent repair" exception applies → separate checkbox
- Include all pre-contractual information per VÕS § 48

**Default withdrawal notice text (Estonian):**

```
TAGANEMISÕIGUS: Teil on õigus käesolevast lepingust taganeda 14 päeva
jooksul ilma põhjust esitamata. Taganemistähtaeg lõpeb 14 päeva
möödumisel lepingu sõlmimisest. Taganemisõiguse kasutamiseks teavitage
meid oma otsusest kirjalikult (e-post, kiri).

Kui soovite, et teenuse osutamist alustatakse enne taganemistähtaja
lõppu, kinnitage seda palun allpool. Sel juhul kaotate taganemisõiguse
teenuse täielikul osutamisel.
```
